Create an annotation legend for a plot.         Because IDL 8.0 contains a LEGEND() function written in IDL, the        original LEGEND procedure in the Astronomy Library is renamed to        AL_LEGEND.     (The original legend.pro remains.)         This procedure makes a legend for a plot.  The legend can contain        a mixture of symbols, linestyles, Hershey characters (vectorfont),        and filled polygons (usersym).  A test procedure, legendtest.pro,        shows legend's capabilities.  Placement of the legend is controlled        with keywords like /right, /top, and /center or by using a position        keyword for exact placement (position=[x,y]) or via mouse (/position).         none         If keyword help is set, call doc_library to print header.        See notes in the code.  Much of the code deals with placement of the        legend.  The main problem with placement is not being        able to sense the length of a string before it is output.  Some crude        approximations are used for centering.         Here are some things that aren't implemented.        - An orientation keyword would allow lines at angles in the legend.        - An array of usersyms would be nice---simple change.        - An order option to interchange symbols and text might be nice.        - Somebody might like double boxes, e.g., with box = 2.        - Another feature might be a continuous bar with ticks and text.        - There are no guards to avoid writing outside the plot area.        - There is no provision for multi-line text, e.g., '1st line!c2nd line'          Sensing !c would be easy, but !c isn't implemented for PostScript.          A better way might be to simply output the 2nd line as another item          but without any accompanying symbol or linestyle.  A flag to omit          the symbol and linestyle is linestyle[i] = -1.        - There is no ability to make a title line containing any of titles          for the legend, for the symbols, or for the text.

EXPLANATION: 	This procedure makes a matrix of plots with *SHARED AXES*, either using 	parameters passed to multiplot or !p.multi in a non-standard way. 	It is good for data with one or two shared axes and retains all the 	versatility of the plot commands (e.g. all keywords and log scaling). 	The plots are connected with the shared axes, which saves space by 	omitting redundant ticklabels and titles.  Multiplot does this by 	setting !p.position, !x.tickname and !y.tickname automatically. 	A call (multiplot,/reset) restores original values.  	Note: This method may be superseded by future improvements in !p.multi 	by RSI.  For now, it's a good way to gang plots together. 	Multiplot sets a number of system variables: !p.position, !p.multi, 	!x.tickname, !y.tickname, !P.noerase---but all can be reset with 	the call: multiplot,/reset 	1. If you use !p.multi as the method of telling how many plots 	are present, you have to set !p.multi at the beginning each time you 	use multiplot or call multiplot with the /reset keyword. 	2. There's no way to make an xtitle or ytitle span more than one plot, 	except by adding spaces to shift it or to add it manually with xyouts. 	3. There is no way to make plots of different sizes; each plot 	covers the same area on the screen or paper. 	This routine makes a matrix of plots with common axes, as opposed to 	the method of !p.multi where axes are separated to allow labels. 	Here the plots are joined and labels are suppressed, except at the 	left edge and the bottom.  You tell multiplot how many plots to make 	using either !p.multi (which is then reset) or the parameter pmulti. 	However, multiplot keeps track of the position by itself because 	!p.multi interacts poorly with !p.position.

This was inspired by the functionality provided by multiplot from IDLAstro     (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/pro/plot/multiplot.pro)     for direct graphics.      But contrary to multiplot, this system works for Graphics (instead of direct     graphics), allows for lines/columns of different heights/widths,     provides global margins and axes titles, and provides a synchronization     mechanism to keep the plots in the same line/column (or all) with the same     axes ranges and properties. Also, like in pp_plot, there is the option     of suppressing the first/last tick marks of the axes, to avoid their overlap     with the neighboring plots (enabled by default, depending on the plot's     location on the grid).      A pp_multiplot object makes a window to hold the grid, and will contain all the     plots in the grid (made with the plot method provided here). The individual     plot objects can be retrieved (for instance, to set/get their properties),     and axes properties can be set (and synchronized) for entire lines/columns     (or all plots in the grid) at a time. The init/get/set methods pass any     extra properties to the window that contains the plot - the window class is     used here, not inherited.      See the documentation on the public methods     pp_multiplot::init, pp_multiplot::plot, pp_multiplot::image,     pp_multiplot::contour, pp_multiplot::getproperty,     pp_multiplot::setproperty, pp_multiplot::sync_axes, ,pp_multiplot::close,     pp_multiplot::save, and pp_multiplot::getposition, for details on their use.
